								<h3>About</h3>
								<p>Our mission is to tackle business challenges while prioritizing exceptional user experience, seamless interactivity, and inclusive web accessibility.
								</a></p>
								<h3>Challenge</h3>
								<p>As a team, we continuously challenge ourselves to set a new standard in valuing web accessibility, user experience, and interactivity. Our goal is to 
									create innovative and inclusive designs that not only enhance digital experiences but also leave a lasting impact on a global scale. Through creativity, 
									collaboration, and a commitment to excellence, we strive to shape the future of design and technology.</p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pixbytelogotests.png" alt="" /></span>
								
									<h3>Market</h3>
									<p>Our strategy for acquiring clients involves multiple channels, including a dedicated landing page, social media platforms (Instagram, 
										Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Behance, and Dribbble), workshops we host, podcasts, and even a Skillshare course. By offering valuable, free 
										resources that share tips and insights on user experience, we aim to educate our audience, empowering them to recognize the difference between 
										good and bad design. This approach not only builds trust and credibility but also establishes us as thought leaders in the industry. Additionally, 
										our social media presence will showcase our designs and provide regular UX and web accessibility tips.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Nuvo Network</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/nuvo.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>About</h3>
								<p>This project aims to enhance NUVO Network's social media presence, with a particular focus on Instagram due to its higher levels of activity. Our goal 
									is to create a cohesive, visually appealing layout that serves as a dynamic space where both current and prospective members can easily explore what 
									NUVO has to offer. Interactivity and community engagement will be central to this approach.<br>

									To inform our design decisions, we will conduct thorough research using a combination of primary sources, including insights from NUVO Network members, 
									and secondary sources by analyzing successful examples from other companies. This comprehensive research will guide us in developing a website that 
									effectively meets NUVO Network's needs and elevates its online presence.</p>
								
									<h3>Reseach Question</h3>
								<p>How can we improve how NUVO interacts with tenants and potential members through their social media platforms?</p>
									<h3>Top Three Methods</h3>
									<h4>Secondary Research</h4>
									<p>Using information that other people have already put together with their own research. Also using publicly available information to better inform our studies.</p>
									<h4>Competitive Product Analysis</h4>
									<p>Using information that other people have already put together with their own research. Also using publicly available information to better inform our studies.</p>
									<h4>Competitive Product Analysis</h4>
									<p>The interview will be a very important aspect of our research still we will be able to get an account of who things work within the company and have the opinions 
										of the staff and members. We will be able to create profiles based off of real people who attend these facilities. The interviews let us observe the reactions 
										and the emotions of individual people and how they feel about the company. With this information we are capable of obtaining new and updated information on the 
										company and members.</p>

									<h3>My Comparative Research</h3>
									<p>My analysis of Project Spaces social media presence.</p>
									<span class="image main" style="background-color:aliceblue;"><img src="images/instadi.png" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image main" style="background-color:aliceblue;"><img src="images/chart.png" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/instan.png" alt="" /></span>

										<p>Project Spaces values personal connections and fosters a sense of community by actively engaging with their members—tagging them in photos and celebrating 
											their involvement. Their feed maintains a strong sense of consistency, with high-quality images that complement each other in tone, color, and subject matter. 
											Additionally, they post frequently, ensuring a dynamic and engaging presence.</p>
								
											<h3>Conclusions</h3>
											<p>In conclusion, our analysis of social media strategies used by other co-working spaces has shown that leveraging all platform features—such as stories, 
												hashtags, and reposting—can significantly boost community engagement and overall traffic. If NUVO adopts these strategies, we believe they could see 
												substantial benefits.</p>

								<h2 class="major">United Way</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/unitedway.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>About</h3>
								<p>My team and I designed a volunteer portal tailored for young adults as an extension of United Way's existing website, enhancing their digital presence and making it 
									easier for young volunteers to get involved.</p>

									<h3>Challenge</h3>
									<p>How do we create new and innovative opportunities for our youth to roll up their sleeves, get involved in our communities and volunteer by contributing their 
										resources and becoming part of initiatives such as the GenNext Program.</p>

										<h3>Planning</h3>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/tab.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>Taking insporation from the stle guide United Way already had, we incorperated that into our new design. The intention of this was to make the new portal 
											look Cohesive with the remainder of the website.</p>

											<span class="image main"><img src="images/persona2.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>The target audience for this portal is college/university student who need to complete mandatory community service hours.</p>
										
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/flowchart.png" alt="" /></span>

										<h3>Marketing</h3>
										<p>We propose a focus on advertising the volunteer opportunities on College/University Job boards with a direct link to the portal. People can create a profile 
											and easily apply to take part in volunteer opportunities in their community.</p>
								
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/hungry.png" alt="" /></span>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/school.png" alt="" /></span>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/stress.png" alt="" /></span>

											<h3>Interface</h3>

											<span class="image main"><img src="images/home.png" alt="" /></span>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/signin.png" alt="" /></span>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/success.png" alt="" /></span>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/profile.png" alt="" /></span>
											
									<p>My team and I proposed a GenNext volunteering board, featured alongside post-secondary job boards to increase visibility and accessibility for young adults. 
										By providing a direct link, the platform makes it easy for users to explore opportunities that match their skills and interests. The portal would also track 
										and update proof of skills, offer networking opportunities, and support personal growth through education and character development. Additionally, we suggested 
										enhancing how United Way presents its volunteer opportunities, making them more appealing to younger demographics. This reimagined approach aims to foster 
										stronger connections and drive greater involvement among young adults, creating a more engaged and empowered volunteer community.</p>
